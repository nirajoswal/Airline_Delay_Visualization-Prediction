# Airline_Delay_Visualization-Prediction
Project Overview:
This project entails a comprehensive analysis of airline data derived from approximately 2 million US domestic flights, focusing on the identification and mitigation of delays and cancellations within the aviation industry. The primary objectives include:

Infrastructure Optimization: Identifying key airports necessitating strategic infrastructure development to alleviate the frequency and severity of flight delays.
Carrier Analysis: Examining the correlations between airline carriers and the occurrence of flight delays and cancellations to inform operational strategies.
Delay Causation: Investigating the primary factors contributing to flight delays at various airports to facilitate targeted intervention measures.
Temporal Patterns: Exploring the relationships between temporal factors such as days of the week and times of day with heightened occurrences of flight cancellations and delays.
In addition to exploratory analysis, the project entails the development of predictive models:

Arrival Delay Prediction: Constructing a predictive model to estimate the arrival delay for flights based on comprehensive attributes, providing valuable insights for both customers and airport authorities.
Cancellation Reason Classification: Building classification models to predict the reasons for flight cancellations utilizing dataset attributes, enabling proactive decision-making within the aviation sector.
By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, this project aims to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and inform strategic decision-making within the aviation industry.

Please note that the classification models and delay prediction models currently under development may not exhibit optimal accuracy levels.I am actively engaged in refining these models to enhance their performance and reliability. All of it is for learning and understanding ML and Neural Network only.Thank you for your continued support.
